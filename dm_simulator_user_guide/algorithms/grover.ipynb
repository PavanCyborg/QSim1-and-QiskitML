    "You have likely heard that one of the many advantages a quantum computer has over a classical computer is its superior speed searching databases. Grover's algorithm demonstrates this capability. This algorithm can speed up an unstructured search problem quadratically, but its uses extend beyond that; it can serve as a general trick or subroutine to obtain quadratic run time improvements for a variety of other algorithms. This is called the amplitude amplification trick."

On a quantum computer, however, we can find the marked item in roughly $\\sqrt{N}$ steps with Grover's amplitude amplification trick. A quadratic speedup is indeed a substantial time-saver for finding marked items in long lists. Additionally, the algorithm does not use the list's internal structure, which makes it *generic;* this is why it immediately provides a quadratic quantum speed-up for many classical problems."

    "uniform superposition: $|s \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{x = 0}^{N -1} | x\n",
    "\\rangle.$\n",

    "If at this point we were to measure in the standard basis $\\{ | x \\rangle \\}$, this superposition would collapse, according to the fifth quantum law, to any one of the basis states with the same probability of $\\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{1}{2^n}$. Our chances of guessing the right value $w$ is therefore $1$ in $2^n$, as could be expected. Hence, on average we would need to try about $N/2 = 2^{n-1}$ times to guess the correct item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the procedure called amplitude amplification, which is how a quantum computer significantly enhances this probability. This procedure stretches out (amplifies) the amplitude of the marked item, which shrinks the other items' amplitude, so that measuring the final state will return the right item with near-certainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm has a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of two reflections, which generate a rotation in a two-dimensional plane. The only two special states we need to consider are the winner $| w \\rangle$ and the uniform superposition $| s \\rangle$. These two vectors span a two-dimensional plane in the vector space $\\mathbb{C}^N.$ They are not quite perpendicular because $| w \\rangle$ occurs in the superposition with amplitude $N^{-1/2}$ as well.\n",
    "We can, however, introduce an additional state $|s'\\rangle$ that is in the span of these two vectors, which is perpendicular to $| w \\rangle$ and is obtained from $|s \\rangle$ by removing $| w \\rangle$ and\n",

The right graphic is a bar graph of the amplitudes of the state $| s \\rangle$.\n",

    "![image3](images/grover_step2.jpg)\n",

    "Geometrically this corresponds to a reflection of the state $|s\\rangle$ about $|s'\\rangle$. This transformation means that the amplitude in front of the $|w\\rangle$ state becomes negative, which in turn means that the average amplitude (indicated by a dashed line) has been lowered.\n",

    "**Step 3**: We now apply an additional reflection ($U_s$) about the state $|s\\rangle$: $U_s = 2|s\\rangle\\langle s| - \\mathbb{1}$. This transformation maps the state to $U_s U_f| s \\rangle$ and completes the transformation. \n",

    "\n",
    "Two reflections always correspond to a rotation. The transformation $U_s U_f$ rotates the initial state $|s\\rangle$ closer towards the winner $|w\\rangle$. The action of the reflection $U_s$ in the amplitude bar diagram can be understood as a reflection about the average amplitude. Since the average amplitude has been lowered by the first reflection, this transformation boosts the negative amplitude of $|w\\rangle$ to roughly three times its original value, while it decreases the other amplitudes. We then go to **step 2** to repeat the application. This procedure will be repeated several times to zero in on the winner. \n",

We can see that the amplitude of $| w \\rangle$ grows linearly with the number of applications $\\sim t N^{-1/2}$. However, since we are dealing with amplitudes and not probabilities, the vector space's dimension enters as a square root. Therefore it is the amplitude, and not just the probability, that is being amplified in this procedure.\n",

We will now solve a simple problem using Grover's algorithm, for which we do not necessarily know the solution beforehand. Our problem is a 2×2 binary sudoku, which in our case has two simple rules:\n",
